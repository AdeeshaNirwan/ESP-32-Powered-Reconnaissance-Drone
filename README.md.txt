## About The Project

![ESP-32 Powered Reconnaissance Drone](drone.jpeg)

The Recon Drone project, developed at Seneca Polytechnic by Adeesha Nirwan and Kwok Ching Chan, represents a significant advancement in the practical application of drone technology. Drawing inspiration from the video game Rainbow Six Siege, this project aims to adapt high-tech gaming concepts for real-world uses in surveillance, search and rescue, and infrastructure inspection.

**Why this project is a standout:**
- It emphasizes **practical application**, transforming virtual concepts into usable technology that enhances safety and efficiency.
- It reduces the repetitive task of starting from scratch by providing a **fully documented template** that others can adapt and improve upon.
- It embodies the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, promoting efficient project setup and execution, which can be applied beyond just programming.

As project needs vary, this README will evolve, and contributions are welcome. You can suggest changes by forking this repo, creating a pull request, or opening an issue. Thanks to everyone who has contributed to refining this template!
